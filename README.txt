Hangman

We present you with a classical game.
All You have to do is to choose an alphabet randomly. 
Simple isn't it? Ha Ha, it only looks simple.
Just go through the instructions first, you’ll know the truth


Here are some instructions, which you should keep in mind before jump into the game.


1) It asks you to make a guess, you have to choose one alphabet one time.
    if by mistake you choose more than one alphabet, the game will reply with some instructions. 
    Just follow those instructions in the next guess.


2) If your guess is wrong, your one body party will be hanged and it will be in order, first head, then hand, and so on. :)))


3) If your guess wrong 6 times, then you will be dead in the game and but obviously lose too :)
    If you guess the whole word letters correctly then You won.


4)If your guess is right and you didn't make 6 mistakes then you got a reply from the computer that you made a good guess.
   It also mentions your wrong guesses(sequence), it will be shown after you did one mistake.
   If you make the same mistake again, it will not add into the wrong guesses sequence
   but mentions to you that you already did this mistake and you have to be more cautious about your next guess. 
   But it'll count this into a mistake. To make the game a little tough I did this.


5)I am extracting words from data.txt(it is in the zip folder). 
  You can add words of your own choice in the data.txt file. Some people want to play with words that they are more familiar with. 
  The only rule you have to take care of is, you have to write a word a comma then space, and again the next word. 
  For the last word in the text file, you don't have to add a comma and space. You can also remove words from a file and it can be of any length. 
  I mean there is no limit in the number of words as such.


6)To Keep it short, I have to drop my pen so that you can enjoy the game.     
                                         Play Hard! Have Fun
